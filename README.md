**ontology modelling semantic data development**

1) The goal of this coursework is to put the ontology modelling semantic data development, Description Logic (DL) and SWRL skills into practice that you have learnt in the Semantic Web lectures and labs in a larger project.
 
2) Your task is to define, populate and query an ontology (including A-Box and a T-box) on a topic of your choice. 
 
3) The ontology must be able to integrate and reuse already available semantic data.
 
4) At least two concepts of the ontology T-Box must be taken from external semantic data repositories.
 
5) This way, the ontology will have an A-Box that can be populated with already existing data.

6) You will use Protégé to design the ontology, and Python-based semantic tooling to populate the ontology with real world data.
